# Responsive Navbar & Styled Login UI (Tasks 3 & 4)

This project demonstrates a responsive navigation bar with a hamburger toggle and a styled authentication UI (Sign in / Create account). It merges the requirements for Task 3 (Styled Login UI) and Task 4 (Responsive Navbar).

## Features
- Responsive navbar with mobile hamburger toggle
- Login link opens the auth panel (hidden by default)
- Sign in and Create account tabs with accessible markup
- Client-side validation (email, password rules) and password strength meter
- Show/hide password buttons

## Files
- `Index.html` — markup for the navbar and authentication UI
- `Index.css` — styles for navbar, responsive layout, and forms
- `Index.js` — JavaScript for navbar toggle, tab switching, validation, and showing/hiding the auth panel

## How to run
1. Open `Index.html` in your browser (no server required).
2. Resize the window to see the navbar collapse at mobile widths.
3. Click the `Login` link in the navbar to open the login/register panel.

## Screenshots / Deliverables
- Capture desktop and mobile screenshots showing the navbar and the auth UI.
- Commit the `Task4` folder to your GitHub repo with this README and screenshots.

## Notes
- All behavior is client-side / demo-only; no backend integration is included.
- Feel free to customize colors and branding in `Index.css`.
